## 🧠 Smart Onboarding State Management

### OnboardingService

**Location**: `src/app/services/onboarding.service.ts`

- `dismissOnboardingPrompts()`: Called when user explicitly skips onboarding
- `hasCompletedOnboarding()`: Checks if user has finished the onboarding flow

**Storage Strategy:**

- Uses `localStorage` to persist onboarding state across sessions
- Tracks both completion and dismissal to avoid repetitive prompting
- Provides reset functionality for development and user preference changes
