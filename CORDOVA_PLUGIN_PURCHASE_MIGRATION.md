# Google Play Billing Library Update - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully replaced the custom Google Play Billing implementation with the mature `cordova-plugin-purchase` plugin. This resolves the Google Play Store error requiring Play Billing Library version 6.0.1 or higher.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed cordova-plugin-purchase

- Added `cordova-plugin-purchase@13.12.1` to the project
- This plugin automatically includes Google Play Billing Library 7.1.1 (meets Google's ≥6.0.1 requirement)

### 2. Created New PurchaseService

- **File**: `src/app/services/purchase.service.ts`
- Provides a TypeScript interface for the cordova-plugin-purchase
- Supports both consumable products (tokens) and subscriptions
- Includes mock implementations for web development
- Handles all purchase lifecycle events (approved, verified, finished, cancelled, error)

### 3. Updated BillingService

- **File**: `src/app/services/billing.service.ts`
- Replaced GooglePlayBillingService with PurchaseService
- Maintains the same public API for existing components
- Updated purchase and subscription flows to use the new service

### 4. Removed Old Implementation

- Deleted `src/app/services/google-play-billing.native.ts`
- Deleted `src/app/services/google-play-billing.service.ts`
- These files contained the custom AIDL implementation that was causing the issue

### 5. Android Project Updates

- **File**: `android/app/capacitor.build.gradle`
- Now includes `com.android.billingclient:billing:7.1.1`
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Retains the required `com.android.vending.BILLING` permission
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/res/xml/config.xml`
- Configured for InAppBillingPlugin

### 2. Better Reliability

./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The implementation is now complete and ready for testing and deployment to Google Play Store.
