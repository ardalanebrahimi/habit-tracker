# Friends Cheering System - Development Tasks

## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Required for MVP)

### Backend Development Tasks

- [ ] **Implement Cheer API Endpoints**

  - [ ] POST /api/cheer - Send cheer endpoint
  - [ ] GET /api/cheer/habit/{habitId} - Get habit cheers
  - [ ] GET /api/cheer/received - Get received cheers
  - [ ] GET /api/cheer/sent - Get sent cheers
  - [ ] GET /api/cheer/summary - Get cheer statistics
  - [ ] DELETE /api/cheer/{cheerId} - Delete cheer (optional)

- [ ] **Database Schema Implementation**

  - [ ] Create cheers table with proper relationships
  - [ ] Add indexes for performance optimization
  - [ ] Set up foreign key constraints

- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization**
  - [ ] Implement user ID resolution in AuthService
  - [ ] Add userId property to HabitWithProgressDTO
  - [ ] Validate cheer permissions (can only cheer friends' habits)
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting for cheer sending

### Frontend Integration Tasks

- [ ] **User ID Resolution**
  - [ ] Update AuthService to provide user IDs alongside usernames
  - [ ] Modify HabitWithProgressDTO to include userId property
  - [ ] Update CheerButtonComponent to use proper user IDs

### Testing Tasks

- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**
  - [ ] Test complete cheer sending workflow
  - [ ] Verify toast notifications display correctly
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios
  - [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing

## üîÑ ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS

### User Experience Enhancements

- [ ] **Toast Integration in Other Components**

  - [ ] Add success toasts for habit completion
  - [ ] Add error toasts for failed habit operations
  - [ ] Add success toasts for connection requests
  - [ ] Add error toasts for network failures

- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] Implement cheer data caching
  - [ ] Add debouncing for rapid cheer sending
  - [ ] Optimize component re-rendering

### Accessibility & Polish

- [ ] **Accessibility Improvements**

  - [ ] Add ARIA labels to cheer modal
  - [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for emoji selection
  - [ ] Add screen reader support for toast notifications
  - [ ] Test with accessibility tools

- [ ] **Animation Enhancements**
  - [ ] Add confetti animation for sending cheers
  - [ ] Improve toast slide-in animations
  - [ ] Add hover effects for better feedback

## üìä TESTING CHECKLIST

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Send cheer to friend's completed habit
- [ ] Verify cheer appears in habit details
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network failure, invalid data)
- [ ] Test toast notifications for all actions
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

### Automated Testing

- [ ] Run existing unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for cheer components
- [ ] Performance testing for large cheer lists
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION

### Pre-Deployment Checks

- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are working
- [ ] Test in staging environment
- [ ] Validate security measures
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Mobile app testing (if applicable)

### Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update API documentation with final endpoint specifications
- [ ] Create user guide for cheering feature
- [ ] Update development setup instructions
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## üìù DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Known Issues to Address:

1. **User ID Resolution**: Currently using userName as fallback for user identification
2. **Backend Dependency**: All functionality depends on backend API implementation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Need to implement client-side and server-side rate limiting

### Technical Debt:

1. **Type Safety**: Some components use `any` types that should be properly typed
2. **Error Handling**: Could be more granular in some components
3. **Caching**: No caching strategy implemented yet

### Future Enhancements:

1. **Cheer Reactions**: Allow users to react to cheers (like, heart, etc.)
2. **Cheer Templates**: Pre-defined cheer message templates
3. **Cheer Statistics**: Analytics dashboard for cheering activity
4. **Bulk Operations**: Send cheers to multiple friends at once

**Status**: Frontend implementation complete, ready for backend integration and testing.
